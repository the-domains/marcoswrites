# A Spine-Chilling 'Lights Out'

Director David F. Sandberg frights with his chilling feature debut 'Lights Out' based on his award winning short. If you are afraid of the dark, this horror flick will be a good reminder as to why one should always double-check lurking shadows -- whether it is an optical trick or not.

Director David F. Sandberg frights with his chilling feature debut 'Lights Out' based on his award winning short. If you are afraid of the dark, this horror flick will be a good reminder as to why one should always double-check lurking shadows -- whether it is an optical trick or not.

James Wan ('Insidious', 'Conjuring') and writer Eric Heisserer ('Final Destination 5', 'The Conjuring 2') complete the team that craft and use classic genre elements that build up the suspense and horror in the film. There's that squeaky door, the sudden thump, and eerie moments -- visually and acoustically -- which enhance the story. The viewer never quite knows when the monster that hides in the dark might just come out. Mind you, it's not just the dark room or poorly lit corner - it is anywhere that light is limited.

The plot in 'Lights Out' is different than most monster-tales often attributed to a child's imagination or encounter. This one is setup with an adult in mind, Sophie, who is easily influenced by the sinister presence that lurks in the shadows. It is ultimately to her kids to save themselves from horrible death. This is where Sandberg and company shine in the plot, relying on the young characters to set the horror and drive the story forward. The viewer cannot help but be emotionally invested in Martin (Gabriel Bateman) who continuously builds up every scene with momentum and distressing reactions throughout. The same can be said about Teresa Palmer who plays the strong, but not-so-exemplary sister polarizing the relationship in this unstable family trio.

The film is filled with low angle shots and sequences that highlight the tone of the movie showing that potential lighting tricks can be just as efficient, if not better than bloody-headless torsos. Heisserer adds to the filmmaker original storyline and makes sure there are enough one-liners to satisfy the genre - and its fans. These are not clichés, at least not all the time, and add to the viewer's admission that when it comes to horror flicks a bit of fun here and there is acceptable. If anything it rounds the characters a bit, and that is what makes for classic horror moments.  
'Lights Out' is a frightening horror debut, set out to trap the viewer for about 80 minutes within a dark theater, to preoccupy him or her with the most basic fear; darkness and what lurks in it.
