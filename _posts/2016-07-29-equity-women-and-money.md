![A scene from "Equity"](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0c05dd5f-0200-4d0f-b880-6b18c72cc9cc.jpg)

Writer **[Amy Fox ][0]**delivers a strong punch in '[Equity][1]', in a story co-written by Sarah Megan Thomas and Alyssa Reiner, where women are behind the movers-and-shakers of Wall Street. Unlike others films that take on the idea of corruption and money laundering schemes, the film focuses in a group of women that are as ambitious as any male counterpart in the same legion.

Equity follows Naomi, a corporate investment banker in the brink of a deal that will either make or break her career. She has a reputation to "rub people the wrong way" mostly because of her matter-of-fact approach, and business driven persona. Of course, she makes no apologies for what has become second nature to her. In a world where the glass ceiling is obviously disparaging, it is her passion, business decisions and cold calculations that will ultimately cost her future.

Director **[Meena Menon ][2]**('Farah Goes Bang', 'Mark in Argentina') creates a good contrast of a world where women continue to battle for recognition, as serious business-savvy individuals and not because they wear the right (or wrong) dress. She paints a sophisticated world in the film, clean and elegant, serious and seducing -- at times menacing for the women who are surrounded by men who continue to make decisions for them. The question continues to be, can women have it all?! And therein lies the conundrum Menon and company are not able to fully answer.

Perhaps because it is not just about the old "battle of the sexes" but an individual's disposition and what will one do to get ahead. Naomi, played brilliantly by Anna Gunn, is one woman who starts the film saying; "I like money" but ends up screaming at an associate when there are not enough chocolate chips in her cookie -- which waters downs the powerful message. Words like money and ambition are repeated, or misconstrued, by the two women that surround Naomi's life at the moment. Whether or not to hint that not even women should trust one another.

'Equity' fares well in a genre that mostly focuses in the male-driven stories of Wall Street. The characters are fiercely presented, and the actors enhance the words and ideas of people that want to have it all, no matter who gets hurts in the end.
