Hollywood is trying to desperately fill the void that the "Lord of The Rings" franchise and the "Harry Potter" series left behind. Legendary Pictures partners with Blizzard Entertainment to bring a fantasy film based on a 1994 video game.

Director **Duncan Jones**("Moon", "Source Code") tries to build drama, and character development into what is essentially a tactical warfare game. This is the idea behind the original console game released on PC and Mac computers, before Xbox, PlayStation and Halo ever existed. '[Warcraft][0]' is not a movie for the millennials, who have probably moved away from the fantasy genre and might be interested in guns and 'Purge'-like stories. In other words, it is a story that has been done before. The audience will yawn at another battle between humans and orcs.

The plot is set for the beginning of the franchise. The Orc world Draenor is dying and a valiant group decide to travel to a new world led by Gul'dan (**Daniel Wu**), and Durotan (**Toby Kebbell**) the leader of the Frostwolf clan -- the latter filled with doubts and the magic powers around to create their safe haven. Azeroth is the new land that they must conquer in order to survive -- but the different races that live in harmony within the realm are not united and it is up to the King of Stormwind to lead a resolution. Every character tries to ensure peace but eventually battle lines are drawn and the story marks the first chapter of the saga.

The main problem in 'Warcratf' is that there are too many characters and subplots going on at any given time. Yes, the audience needs to get to know them, but when there are so many saving graces for everyone it is more difficult to root for them. The characters that stand out are quickly dismissed too, and those who will continue on the story have yet to fully mature or show a convincing side for any audience member to fully invest themselves onto the next chapter.

The film does have some redeemable qualities with some great action sequences and scenes. All of which get enhanced in the IMAX experience creating a fantastic world. But that's the idea behind 'Warcraft', and the fact that we -- the audience - might not care much for the characters but about who is winning the battle and its whimsical setting. It certainly will not make anyone pick up a copy of the game or book is based on, but it will drive people to escape reality for about 123 minutes.
