Watch out Dory, Max and company stroll into theaters with witty repartee and visual appeal in 'The Secret Life of Pets'. The fifth installment of the Illumination-Universal collaboration proves that animated films continue to infuse the box office with marvelous characters and adventures that satisfy kids and adults alike.

The story follows Max, a NYC Terrier living a domesticated and spoiled life. No worries in the world, except for the mysterious routine that his owner, Katie, takes every day. Max's dog life is pleasant aside from the many unanswered questions like; "Where do humans go all day?" The same can be said about his neighboring pets, that at first glance seem like the normal cat, dog, and parakeet. They are anything but normal with strange idiosyncrasies that make them an interesting group of friends. But nothing is stranger than Max's possessive behavior when Katie adopts a new dog named Duke. Both fight over the alpha male status in the house which leads to a fun-filled quest involving alligators in the sewers and a slightly maniacal white rabbit called Snowball.

**Bryan Lynch**,**Cinco Paul** and **Ken Daurio** are the screenwriting team behind the 'Minions' and 'Despicable Me' series. It comes to no surprise that the dialogue is filled with clever one-liners and hilarious situations that will have everyone in the audience laughing from the start. Every animal character is highlighted throughout the story in 'The Secret Life of Pets' without rushing the action and adding to the reason why all of these animals can relate, or not, to one another. The most captivating by far, is Snowball, voiced by **Kevin Hart** that serves as the leader of "The Flushed Pets" living in the cesspits of the Big Apple. He might be a cutesy-little rabbit but has an affinity for vengeance, and crazy diatribes, that take the idea of animated villain to a new level.

Illumination creates a visually stunning world of the city, and each character is perfectly animated. From the sprawls of menacing alligators to the hairy, or hairless, animals that appear in the film. Every single detail is meticulous throughout showing how the computer animated world has evolved from its early conception into entertaining feature films. 'The Secret Life of Pets' is a great achievement for Illumination studios. Minions, kinds, adults and movie-critics will be happy with the new addition to the roster.

_The film opens nationwide tomorrow July 8_
