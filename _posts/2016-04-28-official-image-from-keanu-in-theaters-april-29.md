  It is a bit silly to think that an action film with a kitten in the lead can
  be any good. ‘Keanu’ proves that at times the underdog, even though it comes
  in the form of a cat, might offer a surprising, and entertaining time from
  beginning to end.

It is a bit silly to think that an action film with a kitten in the lead can be any good. 'Keanu' proves that at times the underdog, even though it comes in the form of a cat, might offer a surprising, and entertaining time from beginning to end.
![A scene from "Keanu"](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/339eaa68-9102-4681-823b-e6c44542550d.jpg)

Comedy Central's Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key are the perfect combination in a story line that takes on the serious and absurd ideas about action packed flicks. Along the way they hit the usual stereotypes and gimmicks that audiences are used to seeing in films but giving them a unique take -- which creates laugh-out-loud moments.

The premise is quite simple, when Rell's (Peel) kitten Keanu is taken from his home; he and his friend Clarence (Key) decide to track down the culprit. They soon find themselves way over their heads in a world of drugs, gang and violence that ultimately changes who they are. Also the fact, that like many cats Keanu has lived many lives before, as Iglesias and other such names. 

One of the most hilarious scenes in the film takes the duo back to a strip club owned by Cheddar (Method Man) to celebrate the latest deal from the gang. Clarence is so caught up in the persona he has created that in a moment of rivalry samples a deadly combination of drugs. The trip-induced scene reveals Keanu Reeves voicing a daring kitten and revealing many recognizable one-liners.

'Keanu' is an entertaining action comedy film that will earn the audiences' heart. Every punch line and absurd situation works throughout the film. And if you don't need a good laugh, there is a cute kitten to soften your heart too.
