'[_The Legend of Tarzan_][0]' swings into theaters this weekend meeting high expectations for the film and the sluggish box office season. If the movie earns its production budget stateside than that would be a Hollywood miracle.**David Yates **direction and innovative story seem like a perfect combination for the holiday weekend. After all, the man behind a few renowned _Harry Potter _film chapters should be able to deliver an entertaining and brand new adventure. The special effects take care of the world around Tarzan, but the action is mostly sluggish from beginning to end.

Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' fictional character, screenwriter duo Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer ('Hustle & Flow') craft a tale of a grown Tarzan, and his civilized persona John Clayton III, who struggles with the legend he embodies. Lord Greystoke, as he is often referred to, is a noble man who wishes nothing more but to leave behind the African jungle and its mysticism. Even though, he amuses young children, politicians, and his wife from time to time with ideas of the wild. He wants nothing to do with it -- at first. If that's not enough the writers add a political tone to convince his character to return and save the land he used to call home. If the ideas sound conflicting that is because they are.

**Alexander Skarsgård**, from HBO's _True Blood_, commands presence as Tarzan in the film making every gesture, line delivery and nuance interesting to watch.**Margot Robbie **('The Wolf of Wall Street') shares that spotlight as Jane embodying a strong and determined character. Both actors do their best to bring some life into a novel take of the legendary tale -- which is at times weak. This is mostly due to the subplot that tries to sneak in from time to time as the writers, and Yates too, create flashbacks to fill-in the backstory of Tarzan. These are unnecessary, and often irritating, because they do not move the story forward -- hence the lethargic nature of the adventure.

The world of the jungle is breathtaking and the 3D and IMAX experience will certainly enhance the backdrop in 'The Legend of Tarzan'. The special effects create the magic of the Congo, that sometimes feels artificial but one has to accept at the same time because how else would you put a human next to a dangerous animal. The one scene that is particularly fun to watch is that of Tarzan fighting off an ape, his ape- sibling per se, in a territorial battle that satisfies the action-driven story in the film. After all, the legend of Tarzan cannot exist without the authoritative presence of the wild.

There are some entertaining scenes in the film, but not sure if they are enough to make audiences spend their money at the box office this weekend. The story is particularly troublesome and nowadays moviegoers look for a well-driven plot -- which is one of the reasons that 'Finding Dory' is doing so well in ticket sales. Can 'The Legend of Tarzan' compete? Let's wait and see.
