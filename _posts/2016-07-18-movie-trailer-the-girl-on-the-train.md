  Everyone loves Emily Blunt. If you don’t, then something is wrong with you.
  Her latest role in ‘The Girl on the Train’ is far from any of the previous
  cheeky, uplifting characters. In the film, Rachel Watson (Blunt) ponders about
  her life from a skewed perspective. Check out the latest trailer released on
  the official site. Beyond creepy.
