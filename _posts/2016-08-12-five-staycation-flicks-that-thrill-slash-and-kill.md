# Five Staycation Flicks that Slash, Kill and Thrill

Summer in NYC is often filled with outdoor events, rooftop cocktails, and BBQ at the park or nearby beach. But a staycation whether forced upon or to gather one's energy is meant to happen at some point or another. If binge-watching the latest Netflix series is not your cup-of-tea then I have five films that will scare and excite the mellow hours in your humble abode (while in bed or the couch). In no particular order, the stories herein take place inside, or in one simple location, where the protagonist(s) have nowhere to run -- some ultimately escape uncertain death and their respective antagonist(s). Others are not so lucky.

'[Dial M for Murder][0]' (1954) is a classic masterpiece. [Alfred Hitchcock][1] takes on this detective story surrounding an ex-tennis player who is married to a wealthy socialite. [Grace Kelly][2] is the-sad-socialite torn between true love and her deceitful husband. He ultimately plans her murder. I'm not significantly giving away the premise here, as the audience is privy to the information from the start, but the characters and melodrama build the suspense throughout. Leave Hitchcock genius camera movement and lightning style to fashion a deadly attack that will have you gasping for air -- literally.

What would you do if you knew the immediate threat was coming from inside the house? That is the setting for '[When a Stranger Calls][3]', not the cult classic, but the 2006 remake. Critics and naysayers might not have been kind to the film, but after grossing over $65 million, this little slasher flick will have you turn the ringer off your phone (or at least on silent). The story follows Jill ([Camilla Belle][4]) who is having one of those teenage angst episode, and like most has used all of her cellphone minutes (texting was not big in 2006, I think). In order to pay the bill, she takes on a babysitting job for a wealthy family in town. Never mind that a recent murder of a babysitter, on the other side of town, remains unresolved. The setting is perfect for a flick that embodies the classic tricks of the genre: shadows, noises, and a perfectly manicured house. Oh, and a string of phone calls that at first tickles Jill's fancy but ultimately reveal a deadly peril.

Director [William Friedkin][5] is well-known for 'The Exorcist', but in 2007 he shaped another terrifying thriller starring [Ashley Judd][6]. '[Bug][7]' is an independent film that restricts the leading character to a confined space. Agnes White (Judd) is a server who lives in a run-down motel in Oklahoma, and is unable to move from a tragic past. She drinks and takes every drug available to her -- and after a casual encounter with a drifter, she starts believing that bugs are infesting her body and possibly manufactured by the government. It sounds weird to think such a story can be terrifying, but the thing about 'Bug' is the acting range that Judd commands from beginning to end -- which all translates to psychological horror, and nothing is scarier than losing one's mind.

'[10 Cloverfield Lane][8]' is not a sequel to J.J. Abram's 2008 '[Cloverfield][9]' -- which is worth noting for the next pick. Unlike the found-footage movie, director [Dan Trachtenberg][10] scares the audiences using unfinished and small spaces, a menacing lead character and a plausible scenario. Michelle ([Mary Elizabeth Winstead][11]) is rescued, or captured, by Howard ([John Goodman][12]) who is keeping her safe from an unknown chemical attack. From the very start, the viewer is left wondering how much truth is behind Howard's apocalyptic situation, and whether or not Michelle will be able to flee the bunker. Entrapment, control and fear are served in 103 minutes. The movie may not be among the critics' favorites, but for true fans the Blu-ray disc is a must-have for the extras, commentaries, and featurettes that give a fuller idea behind Abram's inclusion of this chapter in the anthology. See if you can find the missing puzzle pieces that are part of the story too.

Next is '[All the Boys Love Mandy Lane][13]' starring [Amber Heard][14] ('Friday Night Lights', 'Magic Mike XXL') as a high school teenager, who is seen as an outsider by the popular crowd, and gets invited to a weekend getaway after blossoming into a beautiful swan. Nothing is more frightening, or attractive, that teenage angst and a mysterious killer thrown into a secluded ranch. The film itself had a problematic run, shot in 2006, and being released in theatres on October 11, 2013 for Halloween - critics did not love 'Mandy Lane'. The camera work and scene sequences are really what will have you on edge, as the body count and one-liners seal this slasher film as light popcorn-fun. Oh, and Amber Heard is either saint or pariah.

Well, here are the five films that are set to thrill your own incarceration (at home of course!) The films are noteworthy due to the elements within the production too. Renowned directors, producers and actors are part of the tragic tale -- which features startling acting from their respective leading women. All of the films are available to stream on iTunes, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Vudu, MGo and Xfinity as well as other popular online and cable service providers.
