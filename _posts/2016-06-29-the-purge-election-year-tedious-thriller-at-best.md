Director **James DeMonaco** goes for the so-called political jugular in '[The Purge: Election Year][0]' on what is, yet another, much-anticipated sequel this summer. In reality, the film is the third installment in _The Purge _film series, but this new chapter brings back characters from 2014's 'Anarchy' to set things in motion.

In 2025, Senator Charlene Roan (**[Elizabeth Mitchell][1]**) becomes the first presidential hopeful to argue against the yearly Purge-night that has been established by "The New Founding Fathers of America" in the last 15-years. Leo Barnes (**[Frank Grillo][2]**) joins the story line as the senator's head of security, who continues to drive against "The Purge" after his experience two years prior. Here is where DeMonaco connects the dots back to 'Anarchy' satisfying the fans' admiration for the characters that make that chapter highly successful at the box office.

However, the NFFA is not pleased with Roan's stance, and instead of finding compromise or playing a witty political game, decide that if this is to be "the final purge" then they get to do some "spring-cleaning" a-la assassination style. Nothing is more insulting than someone that decides to go against the government, right? DeMonaco mixes in some dialogue in the story that could resonate in today's news headlines -- from unhappiness among the poor to the glass ceiling in the U.S. political arena. But it is not as meaty as it should be if that is his personal commentary or simple satire. Then again, this is _The Purge_ film series so the only thing that matters is the body count, and the gruesome ways that murder can be filmed.

If you are a fan of the series, then you are in good company. For the newly introduced 'The Purge: Election Year' is a thriller-horror film that is filled with one-liners that run the stereotype ladder. Every actor here is anchored in their specific role: Grillo is the hero, ex-cop that often saves the day, Mitchell is the strong-female character that is overshadowed by her male counterparts, and [Mykkelti Williamson][3] gets to be the token "Joe". Mix them all in with some slow-motion camera movements, stylized lighting and action-filled scenes and it all becomes a repetitive structure.

Yes, the main plotline is to save Roan, everyone gets that, but how often do the characters need to run around in circles to find themselves in the same predicament. Wait, I forgot. _The Purge_ film series is about the body count, and how people can be dismembered, set on fire, guillotined, and shot. It is particularly difficult to think that in our current environment this film could be watched without recoiling after violent gunshots are fired in key scenes - yet there is a thunderous clap every time. Has the audience become the desensitized characters in the film too? The box office will tell if 'The Purge: Election Year' is a winner during the long holiday weekend.

_The Purge: Election Year opens nationwide on Friday, July 1, 2016\._
