That is the question that <strong>Matt Ross</strong> ('28 Rooms') offers the audience in ‘<a href="www.captainfantasticmovie.com">Captain Fantastic</a>’ chairing as both writer and director in the film. There might be many answers to the question – but one thing is for sure the story is a journey to many possibilities. Ultimately, it is up to the viewer to decide what makes for good or bad parental guidance.</p><p>Ben Crash, perfectly played by <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001557/">Viggo Mortensen</a></strong>, is raising his children far away from the grid and commercialism. He is the patriarch of the tribe - and as such - trains, educates, directs and influences the way his six warriors daily interact with one another in the small commune. The wild and lush background of the Pacific Northwest provides great shelter and environment to raise a group of “philosopher kings” – as the children are often referred to by their late mother. A dose of reality sets in once Ben has to travel to New Mexico for the mother’s funeral. Nothing is more shocking to him, and the young troop, when the differences in child-rearing come up that are not only thought provoking but can be deemed legal (or not).</p><p>Ross is very careful to craft a story that exposes a different idea of bringing up children, and then compares that to the way everyday people think about it too. Ben is untraditional, and so his ways of teaching, and training his kids are completely different from the norm – society’s normal that is. There is no child care center in his world. There are no iPhones, iPads or handheld video games that act as the momentary babysitter to distract the children. Instead, there is rigorous physical training, and a meaningful diet that will build a strong body to survive the elements of nature (if not the world). You are what you kill in Ben’s perfect Utopia - which is the only way to behave, to eat and sometimes to clothe.</p><p>There are many significant and splendidly acted scenes in ‘Captain Fantastic’. The most poignant is when Ben’s older child Bo (George MacKay) confronts his father to endure a fact that even after all his teaching of modern literature and Noam Chomsky’s philosophy, and the easily understanding of Bach’s mesmerizing <em>Suites</em> he cannot relate to others – especially someone of the opposite sex. Therein one of the the ideas that even after all the illuminating education Ben has in away make Bo, if not all his children, powerless in the real world. A resounding message that is both intelligent and heavily sad to a father who is trying to find a balance in life.</p><p>‘Captain Fantastic’ is an independent film that queries serious thinking on the audience’s part. At one time or another you might have to Google the details in the brilliantly crafted dialogue to fully understand, and connect the dots. But that’s the idea behind this film that one leaves the theater thinking about it, and if you are a parent even much more so as to consider whether or not your parental skills are up to par.</p><p>Check out the official trailer in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5jeBvjcJe4">YouTube</a></p><p><em>The film opens at Lincoln Square 13 and Landmark Sunshine Cinema in NYC.</em></p><p><em>The film is rated R with a running time of 119 minutes.</em></p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="54"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="56"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="57"><span data-reactid="58"><!-- react-empty: 59 --><h2 data-reactid="60"><a data-reactid="61">Marcos Writes</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="62"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="63"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="64"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="65"></div></section></div></div>
