            <title><![CDATA[‘Equity’ on Women and Money]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>‘Equity’ on Women and Money</h1><p>Writer Amy Fox delivers a strong punch in 'Equity', in a story co-written by Sarah Megan Thomas and Alyssa Reiner, where women are behind the movers-and-shakers of Wall Street. Unlike others films that take on the idea of corruption and money laundering schemes, the film focuses in a group of women that are as ambitious as any male counterpart in the same legion.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/44ea05d5-b409-49b7-9245-d34ddb6ef318.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Humor Sells in ‘War Dogs’]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Humor Sells in ‘War Dogs’</h1><p>Director Todd Phillips from ‘The Hangover’ trilogy brings real-world events into his new feature film ‘War Dogs’. The story could essentially be a critical take on the distressing effects of the Afghan war in the U.S. economy – but Phillips and company turn the topic on its head creating a light-hearted comedy. David Packouz (Miles Teller), the narrator in the story, opens the film with a different perspective than most people have when analyzing war times. You and I see an American soldier defending our liberties overseas, but Packouz sees dollar signs and the unsurmountable amount of money spent to fund a war.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/55b266e2-0f66-44b4-9604-188c507c3699.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'The Purge: Election Year' Tedious Thriller</h1><p>Director James DeMonaco goes for the so-called political jugular in ‘The Purge: Election Year’ on what is, yet another, much-anticipated sequel this summer. In reality, the film is the third installment in The Purge film series, but this new chapter brings back characters from 2014’s ‘Anarchy’ to set things in motion. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fa3d859c-6deb-45d6-8471-83cebc07bfc2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Spine-Chilling ‘Lights Out’</h1><p>Director David F. Sandberg frights with his chilling feature debut 'Lights Out' based on his award winning short. If you are afraid of the dark, this horror flick will be a good reminder as to why one should always double-check lurking shadows – whether it is an optical trick or not.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/919eb975-48b7-45ca-9847-d584f61b9d38.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>‘Tarzan’ Tries to Reign Action</h1><h2>Tarzan Tries to Reign in Action in the Jungle</h2><p>‘The Legend of Tarzan’ swings into theaters this weekend meeting high expectations for the film and the sluggish box office season. If the movie earns its production budget stateside than that would be a Hollywood miracle.David Yates direction and innovative story seem like a perfect combination for the holiday weekend. After all, the man behind a few renowned Harry Potter film chapters should be able to deliver an entertaining and brand new adventure. The special effects take care of the world around Tarzan, but the action is mostly sluggish from beginning to end.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d63d8156-013a-4267-a147-0a521e3f1774.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Five Staycation Flicks that Slash, Kill and Thrill]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Five Staycation Flicks that Slash, Kill and Thrill</h1><p>Summer in NYC is often filled with outdoor events, rooftop cocktails, and BBQ at the park or nearby beach. But a staycation whether forced upon or to gather one’s energy is meant to happen at some point or another. If binge-watching the latest Netflix series is not your cup-of-tea then I have five films that will scare and excite the mellow hours in your humble abode (while in bed or the couch). In no particular order, the stories herein take place inside, or in one simple location, where the protagonist(s) have nowhere to run – some ultimately escape uncertain death and their respective antagonist(s). Others are not so lucky.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3f6dd144-38b9-4a3f-a8f9-fbb65f410693.jpg"></article>]]></description>
